Array::PrintCols, version 2.0, is a Perl 5 module which defines a
subroutine to print arrays of elements in alphabetically, vertically
sorted columns.  Optional arguments can be given to control either the
width or number of the columns, the total width of the output, and the
amount of indentation.

The module has embedded POD text with which man or HTML pages can be
created.

For detailed usage information, you can do:

    pod2man PrintCols.pm | nroff -man 

The module is accompanied with Makefile.PL, this README, some test
programs, a reference test output file, and the GNU License, under
which this software is freely available.

The archives are available at the nearest CPAN site, under the
directory "modules/Array".

Contributions or improvements are welcome.
