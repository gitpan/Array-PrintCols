Array::PrintCols, version 2.1, is a Perl 5 module which defines a
subroutine to print arrays of elements in alphabetically, vertically
sorted columns.  Optional arguments can be given to control either the
width or number of the columns, the total width of the output, and the
amount of indentation.

This release includes: a new routine, "format_cols", which returns the
formatted result as a string (thanks to Gisle Aas <aas@bergen.sn.no>
for the suggestion); some slight changes to the test routine; some
improvements to the documentation.

The module has embedded POD text with which man or HTML pages can be
created.

For detailed usage information, you can do:

    pod2man PrintCols.pm | nroff -man 

The module is accompanied with Makefile.PL, this README, a test
program, a reference test output file, and the GNU License, under which
this software is freely available.

To install the software:

	gunzip Array-PrintCols-2.1.tar.gz
	tar xvf Array-PrintCols-2.1.tar
	cd Array-PrintCols-2.1
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test && make install

The archives are available at the nearest CPAN site, under the
directory "modules/Array".

Contributions or improvements are welcome.
