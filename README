Array::PrintCols is a Perl 5 module which defines a subroutine to
print arrays of elements in alphabetically, vertically sorted columns. 
Optional arguments can be given to control either the width or number of
the columns, the total width of the output, and the amount of
indentation. 

The module has embedded POD text with which man or HTML pages can be
created.

For detailed usage information, you can do:

    pod2man PrintCols.pm | nroff -man 

The module is accompanied with a Makefile, this README, a test program
(test.pl), a reference test output file, and the GNU License, under
which this software is freely available.

The archives are available on:

    ftp://hub.ucsb.edu/pub/prog/perl/Array-PrintCols-$VER.shar
    ftp://hub.ucsb.edu/pub/prog/perl/Array-PrintCols-$VER.tar.gz

where $VER is the latest version.

Contributions or improvements are welcome.
